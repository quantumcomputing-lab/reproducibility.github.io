(March 23, 2022) Microsoft's topological qubit</A>
</H2>
It goes without saying that to prove their scientific and commercial worth, quantum computers not only need to show speed and/or size advantage over classical computers but they also need to be reliable. One way of ensuring reliability is using Majorana zero modes. They can enable device reliability and computational reproducibility by protecting quantum information better than alternate technologies and are generally considered a big step forward towards a fault-tolerant quantum computer.

<P>
Recently, Microsoft demonstrated the building blocks for a topological qubit using Majorana zero modes (to reiterate, no qubit as yet and definitely no quantum computer). In particular, they "created and sustained a quantum phase with Majorana zero modes and a measurable topological gap" (which quantifies the stability of the phase).

<P>
"There were a pair of telltale energy signatures called zero bias peaks, which indicate the presence of Majorana zero modes at both ends of a nanowire thatâ€™s been tuned into a topological phase. Previously, that signature had only been seen at one end of the wire and not in combination. There was also another pattern in the electrical conductance data that provided evidence of a topological gap, which is measurement that quantifies how immune the topological phase is to environmental disturbance. The team needed to see the gap closing and reopening - along with the simultaneous appearance of the two zero bias peaks - which they did clearly for the first time."

<P>
What are the next steps for Microsoft? Well, plenty. To start with they need to make the topological gap stable, they need to show how to entangle Majorana building blocks to make a qubit, they need to implement logical gates, and they also need to solve the elephant in the room: scaleability.
