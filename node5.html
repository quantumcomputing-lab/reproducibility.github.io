A) Superconducting qubits:
Transmon based architectures have the largest number of qubits. It is an open question however whether they will continue to scale since shorter coherence times might make it too hard for qecc to keep up. In fact, I wonder if there will be a Moore's law like effect (or rather the failure of Moore's law like effect). One might ask, how will coherence hit its limits and hence what kind of limitations on q adv are we going to hit upon. 

<P>
B) Trapped ions
Have their own scalability issues. 

<P>
C) Spin qubits (e.g. quantum dots)
precise control down to the last spin possible
decoherence no longer a bottleneck (nuclear spins and spin-orbit interaction are now the dominant source of decoherence and relaxation and need to be improved)
great for scaling once they get going but still down in the few qubits at the moment
[Prospects for Spin-Based Quantum Computing: Christoph Kloeffel, Daniel Loss]

<P>
D) Majoranas
Suspected to properties that make them noise resilient. No qubits yet.

E) Photonics
