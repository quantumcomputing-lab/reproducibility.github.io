(March 26, 2022) Defining Quantum Data Science</A>
</H2>
We have often heard that quantum computation has the potential to revolutionize data science. Does data science have the potential to advance quantum computation? The latter is what seems to be called Quantum Data Science while the former is called Quantum machine learning and/ or Quantum AI. These are just evolving traditions and nothing rational about the names.

Note the subtle difference between quantum speedup (e.g. grover's search - a special case of a large class of quantum algorithms based on quantum walk and quantum Markov chain that allow for quantum speedups over their classical counterparts; the gain is not mind blowing but still very useful) and quantum supremacy (you are able to do what is practically impossible to do with classical computers). 

<P>
By the way, what is Data Science? It is simply using statistics in combination with prior domain knowledge to solve problems involving big data. The field often involves careful experiment design, data collection and analysis, assumption validation, and model assessment. It often involves a trade-off between optimality of the statistical/ mathematical technique and computationally efficiency. There is often a clash between the two.
